# Lab 5: Getting a sense of the world around you
This repo contains the project files and PCB designs for Lab 5 by Damon Boorstein and Brendan Nugent.

It is organized into the following sub-folders:
* PCB Design
* Sensors and Signal Conditioning
* Visualizing Data

## PCB Design

Contains the PCB design files for a MSP430FR2311 breakout board capable of operating as a standalone device. The breakout board has proper reset circuitry and is designed to plug into a standard breadboard. The folder contains a .zip file of the files outlined by the Rowan University ECE Department guidelines for PCB ordering, a bill of materials, and image files of the PCB design.

## Sensors and Signal Conditioning

Contains project files for the Sensors and Signal Conditioning section of the lab.

## Visualizing Data

Contains project files for the Visualizing Data section of the lab.
